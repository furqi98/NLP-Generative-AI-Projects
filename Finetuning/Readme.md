Here’s a **README.md** for your fine-tuning GPT-2 project:

# **GPT-2 Fine-Tuning for Question-Answering**  

## 📌 **Overview**  
This project fine-tunes **GPT-2** for **question-answering (QA)** tasks. It takes a dataset of QA pairs, processes the data, and trains a GPT-2 model using **Hugging Face's Transformers** and **PyTorch**. The model learns to generate answers based on input questions.  

---

## 🚀 **Features**  
- **Preprocessing:** Loads and cleans a CSV dataset of QA pairs.  
- **Data Splitting:** Divides data into **training, validation, and test** sets.  
- **Fine-Tuning:** Uses **GPT-2** with cross-entropy loss to train on QA pairs.  
- **Evaluation:** Computes **Precision, Recall, and F1-score** for model performance.  
- **Checkpointing:** Saves model weights during training.

## 🛠️ **Setup & Installation**  
### **1️⃣ Install Dependencies**  
Run the following command to install the required Python packages:  
```bash
pip install torch transformers scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

### **2️⃣ Load Dataset in Google Colab**  
Upload `qa_pairs.csv` to Colab or specify the correct dataset path in the script.  

---


## 📊 **Evaluation Metrics**  
After training, the model is tested on the validation & test sets.  
It computes:  
✅ **Precision** – How many predicted answers are correct?  
✅ **Recall** – How many correct answers are retrieved?  
✅ **F1-score** – Balance between Precision & Recall.  

---

## 🎯 **How to Run the Script**  
1️⃣ Upload `qa_pairs.csv` to your working directory.  
2️⃣ Run `Finetuning_GPT2_WebCrawledDataset.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.  
3️⃣ Start training with:  
```python
!python fine_tune_gpt2.py
```
4️⃣ Evaluate the trained model on test data.
